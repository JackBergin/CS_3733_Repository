In this project, myself along with 9 other people were put on a team to utilize agile development over the course of 7 weeks to build Brigham and Women's Hospital an application to track and sign out equipment. As a part of this team, I was the Lead Software Engineer and undertook the development of our team's Embedded, and Client Server Database, along with the development of our team's API, and the integration of two other team's API within the project. As part of this team, I worked with various subgroups to stay organized and to merge code. As the Lead Software Engineer I was also the head of the team's github repository and would fix and merge and pull requests for myself and my team. At the end of this class I can say that I am increadibly strong in Java, several programming patterns (such as DAO and the Observer pattern), JFX, FXML, CSS, and Apache Derby Database Development.
